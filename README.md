# imgination

Command-line image management utilities. Recursively scans directories
looking for images and reporting on them.

*NOTE:* I really don't recomment using this. No memory management or profiling has been done on it yet; I would't be surprised if it leaks like a seive.

## Features

### Duplicate Image Detection

#### Usage
`imgination --dir=/Users/crash/Pictures --func=dup`

### GPS Co-ordinate Detection

#### Usage
`imgination --dir=/Users/crash/Pictures --func=gps`
